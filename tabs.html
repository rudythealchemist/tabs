                        <p>In the final three minutes Friday, he outscored the Heat 10-8, including the eventual
                            game-winner
                            on a 10-foot floater
                            with 4.4 seconds left. Better late than never for Young, who, by comparison, was a totally
                            different player last
                            postseason. If you recall, he became a villain in New York, then caused the bitter breakup
                            between Ben Simmons and the
                            Sixers</p>

                        <p>When this series began, Spoelstra seemed determined to trap him constantly and force the ball
                            out
                            of Youngâ€™s hands and
                            put other Hawks on the spot, and this worked when Miami took a 2-0 lead and then used a
                            blistering third quarter to go
                            up 11 points in Game 3. Young was flummoxed by then, but as great scorers often do, he found
                            a
                            way, especially when it
                            counts. He only made six baskets all game, but four in the fourth.
